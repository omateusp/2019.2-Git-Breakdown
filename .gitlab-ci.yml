# Gitlab-ci.yml file

# This is the major part of the code which explains the stages present in our pipeline.
# In a django application we have various stages which include testing, packing the code,
# performing migrations, collecting static files and running the application.
# The various stages are broadly classified into 3 main categories:

# 1. Test       2. Release      3. Deploy

stages:
- test
- build

# Stage I
# Testing Phase:
# This is where the main code is tested.
# Other options like code coverage, etc are also written in this phase
